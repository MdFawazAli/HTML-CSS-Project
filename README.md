# Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a static clone of the Amazon homepage built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, created for educational and practice purposes. It mimics the core layout and styling of Amazon's desktop website interface — including the header, search bar, product sections, and footer.

> ❗ This project is not responsive and is intended to be viewed on larger screens (desktop).

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to improve my skills in HTML and CSS layout techniques, especially using Flexbox and Grid, and to replicate a real-world website structure as closely as possible without using JavaScript or frameworks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & basic Grid)
